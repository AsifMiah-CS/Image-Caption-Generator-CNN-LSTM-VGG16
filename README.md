# Image-Caption-Generator-CNN-LSTM-VGG16
This project builds an image caption generator using CNN, LSTM, and the VGG16 model on the Flickr 8k dataset. Achieving BLEU-1 of 0.523 and BLEU-4 of 0.2937, it trains in two steps: feature extraction and model training. Limited by hardware, it uses a batch size of 16 and 30 epochs but could improve with more resources.
